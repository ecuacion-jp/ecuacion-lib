/** 
 * Is an abstact exception class describing an occurence of a validation error in ecuacion apps.
 * 
 * <p>Let us call a validation of data executed by an app an "app-validation". 
 *     {@code AppException} is created and thrown 
 *     when the result of an app-validation is not okay.</p>
 * 
 * <p>App-validations are classified into two kinds as follows.</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>input validation: the validation for each single input data, 
 *     like "not empty", "minimum value", ... </li>
 * <li>business logic validation: the validation from business requirements, 
 *     like "selective not empty", "the input value must be one of values in db", ...</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>{@code BeanValidationAppException} covers the former, 
 *     and {@code BizLogicAppException} the latter. <br>
 *     Both of them are the child of {@code SingleAppException}.</p>
