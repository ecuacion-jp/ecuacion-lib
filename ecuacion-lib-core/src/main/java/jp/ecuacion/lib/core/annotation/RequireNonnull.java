 * Designates that the method throws NullPointerException when the annotated arguments is null.

 * <p>This is almost equal to {@code jakarta.annotation.Nonnull}, 
 *     but {@code @Nonnull} is analyzed by the IDE and IDE warns the nullable parameter.
 *     If you want to show that the method throws NullPointerException 
 *     when the annotated arguments is null, but NO IDE warning needed, use {@RequireNonnull}.</p>
