/**
 * Logs start and end time of the timer-triggered exections, 
 * espacially used in batch programs. Not used for web or rest.
 * 
 * <p>This is mainly expected to use in the ecuacion-lib or other library, 
 * but not in specific apps.<br>
 * Although you can use it in the case that you need to skip the execution in some condition
 * or things like this.</p>
 * 
 * <p>You are also allowed to log what is as important as the start and end status, 
 * but in most cases it's better to log with {@code DetailLogger}.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Available loglevels are as follows:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>info : uses for start and normal end</li>
 * <li>warn : uses for skip and any other special way of enging executions</li>
 * <li>error: uses for abnormal end</li>
 * </ul>
